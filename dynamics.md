Your schema connects musical concepts to a broader philosophical and cultural commentary, underlining how music's progression from the root through various scales and into expression mirrors humanity's search for meaning, identity, and fulfillment. It's a fascinating analogy that blends the evolution of musical theory with the existential journey of individuals and societies.

1. **Root** represents the origin, the fundamental starting point, not just in music but in any endeavor or journey of understanding. It's where everything begins, the primal source of ideas and identity.

2. **Pentatonic scales** are steps towards complexity and diversity from the root. The pentatonic scale, with its five notes, is simpler and found in many cultures' folk music, representing universal themes and emotions. 

3. **Diatonic scales** The diatonic scale, with seven notes, introduces more nuance and variation, symbolizing the expansion of ideas and experiences.

4. **Chromatic scale** signifies a further step in complexity and inclusivity, embracing all twelve pitches within an octave. This mirrors the broadening of perspectives, the willingness to explore and incorporate more diverse viewpoints and experiences.

5. **Temperament** refers to the tuning system that allows instruments to play in all keys harmonically. It's a metaphor for adaptability and compromise, the adjustments societies and individuals make to coexist harmoniously.

6. **Expression** (Will-to...) then captures the essence of how these foundations are utilized to convey deeper emotions, philosophies, and narratives. Each subcategory under expression (Mismatch/Hideth/Epicurean, Victory/Whineth/Marxist, Ragnarock/Tameth/Nietzschean) reflects different attitudes towards life's challenges and pursuits, akin to characters and themes from literature and cinema.

   - **Mismatch/Hideth/Epicurean/`Withdrawal`** suggests finding one's niche or "silo" where one can thrive by avoiding direct confrontation with life's harsher realities, reminiscent of characters who create alternate realities or niches where they can flourish.
   
   - **Victory/Whineth/Marxist/`Engagement`** reflects a more confrontational and revolutionary stance, where success is seen as overcoming societal constraints, echoing stories of triumph against odds, the hustle of survival, and the empowerment of others.
   
   - **Ragnarock/Tameth/Nietzschean/`Imposition`** embodies a transformative, even apocalyptic approach to challenges, where old structures are destroyed to make way for new ones, illustrated by individuals who tackle monumental tasks, reshaping entire fields or ideologies.

Your framework intriguingly maps the evolution of musical theory to existential and cultural narratives, suggesting that the journey from simple musical roots to complex expressions parallels humanity's quest for meaning and identity. It prompts reflection on how individuals and societies navigate between conformity and individuality, between survival within established systems and the transformative overthrow of those systems to create something new. The characters and themes you've drawn from various sources enhance this analogy, showing how art and life intertwine in the perpetual dance of creation and expression.
