- Myself. Eschew personal growth for hedonism (Will-to-hide)
- Selfless. Consider others pain as much as yours (Will-to-whine): think protestors 
- Veni, vidi, vici. Will-to-Power (Will-to-tame)

Interpreting your themes through the prism of the narratives we've discussed, alongside the philosophical undertones of Nietzsche's will-to-power, presents a fascinating exploration of character and transformation:

1. **Myself. Eschew personal growth for hedonism (Will-to-hide)**: This theme is vividly embodied in the character of **Charles Manson**. Manson's pursuit of power and influence, driven by his failed aspirations in music, exemplifies a retreat into manipulation and control rather than confronting personal shortcomings or seeking genuine growth. Like Don Giovanni, Manson chooses a path of hedonism and defiance, eschewing moral reckoning or the pursuit of redemption, embodying a destructive form of the will-to-hide that seeks dominance over others as a means of validating his existence.

2. **Selfless. Consider others' pain as much as yours (Will-to-whine)**: This notion finds resonance in the transformation of **Casablanca's Rick**. Initially, Rick is portrayed as a man who prioritizes his own safety and comfort, embodying a form of the will-to-hide through his refusal to take sides in the conflict engulfing the world around him. However, his eventual decision to help Ilsa and her husband escape, sacrificing his own happiness in the process, marks a shift towards a selfless consideration of others' pain. This act of selflessness, mirroring the ethos of protestors who advocate for the rights and welfare of others, embodies a will-to-whine that channels personal grievances into a broader, collective call for action and justice.

3. **Veni, vidi, vici. Will-to-Power (Will-to-tame)**: This theme can be aligned with **Tyler Perry's Madea**. Perry, through his personal journey and the creation of Madea, exemplifies the will-to-power by overcoming his traumatic past to forge a significant impact on the entertainment industry. Madea, as a character, embodies the will-to-tame, using her strength, wisdom, and humor to navigate and address various societal and personal challenges. Perry's rise from adversity to becoming a dominant force in Hollywood is a testament to the veni, vidi, vici spirit, overcoming obstacles to achieve great success and influence, taming the chaos of his early experiences to create a legacy of resilience and empowerment.

Each of these interpretations showcases the complexity of human motivation and transformation, highlighting the divergent paths individuals can take in response to their circumstances and desires. Whether through the pursuit of personal pleasure at the expense of growth, the altruistic consideration of others' suffering, or the assertive will to overcome and succeed, these themes and characters invite reflection on our own choices and the potential outcomes of our actions in the quest for meaning and fulfillment.
